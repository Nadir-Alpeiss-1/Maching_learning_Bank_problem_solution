# Welcome to Visa For Lisa

## Task
The main goal was to determine who can be potential client for a new service called personal loan of a bank. The dataset was given with 5000 clients.
The main challenge was to define the model and to use new concept called multivariable regression, i.e. implementing several independent parameters on the one side 
and the dependent variable on the other side. Also, there was a challenge of low efficiency of the model due to different type of those variables, i.e. they were logical (1, 0), 
big values and relatively low. 

## Description
To solve the problem I have read corresponding articles and used logistic regression model and scalar in order to make efficiency of the model higher.  

## Installation
One need to enter in the console the following: "jypyter notebook --no-browser" (without commas), then copy the link and open a new one adding 
"web-" just after https://. Then enter "qwasar" (without commas) as a password. 
Choose visa_for_lisa file and then just press play button several times, so one can see that code works.

## Usage
Pressing play button will enable jupyter notebook to run the code, so that everything is seen for a user. 
In addition all the drawings are available so that one can see the significance of the model and its possible outcomes (accuracy of the model).

### The Core Team

I solved this problem by myself, since this task is designed to be solved by one person only.
